> In this project, we focus on zero production fee and serverless architecture.

We use performance tools like svelte, typescript, and golang to build this system. The project aims to provide the system with zero cost and without server machine.

In the frontend, the system does not use any special technique that use server machine. We ship a very small bundle size of this system, created by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) on a static site hosting service on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

In the backend, we use serverless architecture that runs on-demand written by [Golang](https://go.dev/) and ship the system on [DigitalOcean Functions](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/functions)
